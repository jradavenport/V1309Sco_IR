# V1309Sco_IR
what does V1309 Sco look like in the infrared?

Let's look at publicly available IR data from NEOWISE and VVV.

Also, can we find any good new optical observations? Gaia EDR3? It's at -30dec, so pretty far south... (out of ZTF. PS1 maybe?)

Any sign of periodic variability (e.g. in Ferreira+2019)? Cooling in the IR? Settling onto a main-sequence like position as a Blue Straggler?

Can we overlay isochrones in the IR to infer updated physical properties?
